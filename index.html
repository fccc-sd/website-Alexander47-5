            <p>   
               I was born in cincinatti ohio and spent alot of time moving around, I can remember living in 5 different
               houses through my life, 4 were in <br> indiana which is where i spent much of my youth and then we moved
               here to ohio, i've spent the last few years living here and things have <br> been going great,
               I'm going to therapy, i've made some good friends both at here and fairview and
               I am genuinely happy to be alive.
