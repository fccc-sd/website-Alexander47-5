            <p>   
               I was born in cincinatti ohio and spent alot of time moving around, I can remember living in 5 different
               houses through my life, 4 were in indiana which is where i spent much of my youth and then we moved here to ohio,
               i've spent the last few years living here and things have been going great, i'm going to therapy, i've made a lot of
               friends here and am glad to be alive.
