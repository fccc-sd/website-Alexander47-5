               I was born in cincinatti ohio and spent alot of time moving around, I can remember living in 5 different
               houses through my life, 4 were in <br> indiana which is where i spent much of my youth and then we moved
               here to ohio, i've spent the last few years living here and things have <br> been going great,
               I'm going to therapy, i've made some good friends both at here and fairview and
               I am genuinely happy to be alive.

                I play video games, <span id="companies"> mostly the ones by FromSoftware, Larian Studio's and Owlcat Games, </span> I especially love Baldur's gate 3
                and <br> Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. I play Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and Warhammer Fantasy TTRPG games,
                I love the occasional walk <br> and normally walk from my house to a nearby dairy bar 3.4 miles from my house,
                I occasionally stream on youtube and twitch and am an avid music listener, <br> I always have my headphones on and
                almost always have spotify playing unless i'm talking, listening to someone, or during class.

                I went to butler elementary school up until the 4th/5th grade, I can never remember, and then spent several years
                homeschooled, <br> before I went to fairview in 8th grade where I thought I wanted to be a financial advisor, but in 9th grade
                I realized that I would be miserable in that field <br> and so set my sights on four county where I now attend
                the I.T academy with the dream to eventually work for Larian Studios.
