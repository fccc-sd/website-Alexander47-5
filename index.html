               houses through my life, 4 were in indiana which is where i spent much of my youth and then we moved here to ohio,
               i've spent the last few years living here and things have been going great, i'm going to therapy, i've made a lot of
               friends here and am glad to be alive.

            <p>
                I play video games, mostly the ones by FromSoftware, Larian studio's and Owlcat Games, I especially love Baldur's gate 3
                and pathfinder: wrath of the Righteous. I play dungeons and dragons, pathfinder, and warhammer fantasy ttrpg games,
                I love the occasional walk and normally walk from my house to a nearby dairy bar 3.4 miles from my house,
                I occasionally stream on youtube and twitch and am an avid music listener, I always have my headphones on and
                almost always have spotify playing unless i'm talking, listening to someone, or during class.

                My Career + Education
            </h2>

            <p> 
            I went to butler elementary school up until the 4th/5th grade, I can never remember, and then spent several years
            homeschooled, before I went to fairview in 8th grade where I thought I wanted to be a financial advisor, but in 9th grade
            I realized that I would be miserable in that field and so set my sights on four county where I now attend
            the I.T academy with the dream to eventually work for Larian Studios.
