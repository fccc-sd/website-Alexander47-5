<h2>
    My Hobbies
</h2>

    <p>
        I play video games, <span id="companies"> mostly the ones by FromSoftware, Larian Studio's and Owlcat Games, </span> I especially love Baldur's gate 3
        and <br> Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. I play Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and Warhammer Fantasy TTRPG games,
        I love the occasional walk <br> and normally walk from my house to a nearby dairy bar 3.4 miles from my house,
        I occasionally stream on youtube and twitch and am an avid music listener, <br> I always have my headphones on and
        almost always have spotify playing unless i'm talking, listening to someone, or during class.

        <h2>
            My Career + Education
        </h2>

        
    <p> 
        I went to butler elementary school up until the 4th/5th grade, I can never remember, and then spent several years
        homeschooled, <br> before I went to fairview in 8th grade where I thought I wanted to be a financial advisor, but in 9th grade
        I realized that I would be miserable in that field <br> and so set my sights on four county where I now attend
        the I.T academy with the dream to eventually work for Larian Studios.
